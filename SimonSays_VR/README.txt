# SimonSays_VR

This Arduino file is a midified version of the SimonSays.ino file. This version is meant to run along-side the Unity SimonSays Virtual-Reality application.

In this application, the physical Simon Says Dynamixel robot's position is broadcasted to the Unity Application. The Unity application has a giant-sized model of the robot arm, whose position reflects the real-world arm's position.
